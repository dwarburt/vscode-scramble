# scramble README

This extension does a very simple replace to scramble selected text while maintaining the structure. Useful for anonymization but this is not intended for security purposes.

## Features

Provides one command, `scramble` which will replace each uppercase letter, lowercase letter, and digit in the current selection(s) with a random character from the same class.
